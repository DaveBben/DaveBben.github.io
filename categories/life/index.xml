      <description>I am beginning to see the relationship between happiness, anticipation and dopamine.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for reward-driven behavior and pleasure seeking. (Psychology Today). When we get a hit of dopamine, we feel good!
Anticipation is the simple act of looking forward; usually to a pleasurable experience but it could also be negative.
In my previous post about Proven Ways to be Happy Again, I mentioned this thing called hedonic adaptation.</description>

      <description>During the winter holidays (peek depression season), I took a free online course called The Science of Well-Being offered by Yale University. It was actually recommended in a HackerNews comment that I came across in a thread about different MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) to take.
Other than my obsession with self help porn, I took this course because I wanted to learn on how to be happy again with life.</description>

      <description>If you are trying to be more social, consider investing in traditional books over EBooks. I know this sounds crazy, and no, Amazon did not pay me to say this.
Ebooks are missing an important aspect that we have always took for granted in traditional book. There is no easily visible cover! This means people have no idea on what you&amp;rsquo;re reading. With traditional books, its out in the open for everyone to see.</description>

      <description>I am a 2018 college graduate with a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree in computer science. I recently got hired for my first full-time software developer job. As any new graduate, I was eager to go to work and put this shiny new degree to good use. After just a few weeks on the job, I had a horrible realization. Four years of undergrad and \$80K taught me nothing of value for today&amp;#8217;s job market.</description>
