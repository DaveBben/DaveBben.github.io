      <description>Flying a drone with javascript probably sounds crazy and hard. Do I use a framework? Will the 10 GB of node_modules weigh it down? NOPE! It&amp;rsquo;s all pretty simple to do.
The other day I came across a neat drone called the DJI Tello. It is a relatively inexpensive quadcopter that offers a simple SDK which can be accessed over WiFI. Using the NodeJS dgram library, I can send commands via UDP to the drone to perform actions such as takeoff, left 20, and land.</description>

      <description>I had just finished a YouTube that I spent a week working on; a couple of days working on the graphics, a day of voice recording, and a few more hours coming up with a nice thumbnail. I uploaded it, and eagerly awaited the YouTube algorithm to award my quality work with a burst of views and watch time. I sat and waited in anticipation. Hour one went by, nothing. Okay, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a little slow today.</description>

      <title>Google&#39;s Monthly Keyword Search Volume Doesn&#39;t Matter</title>

      <description>I spent the last month focusing a lot on seo (Search Engine optimization). One of the biggest mistakes that I made was using Google&amp;rsquo;s monthly keyword search volume as an indicator on whether a particular keyword has sufficient search volume to pursue. Google&amp;rsquo;s monthly keyword search volume is completely wrong. I found large discrepancies when comparing my actual data from Google analytics to what Google says the traffic should be.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a mental hoarder. If you were to look inside my head, you would find all types of mental clutter. Boxes labeled &amp;ldquo;random shower thoughts&amp;rdquo;, trashcans full of personal bullshit, and a closet overflowing with reminders, ideas and useless information. This creates a negative impact on my ability to recall and recollect. I often find myself in this awkward situation where this was something I know I took a mental note of, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t remember what it was.</description>

      <description>One of the most challenging areas of self discipline in life is time management. I often find myself in situations where I do not have enough time to complete all the things that I want to do. And it&amp;rsquo;s not because I am procrastinating; the second I get home from work I jump right into some new side project or video. The problem is that there are simply too many things that I want to do right now, and learning the personal discipline to say no to myself is challenging.</description>

      <description>For my side project, I needed to scrape Google search using a headless browser. I ended up using the Nodejs library called puppeteer. It&amp;rsquo;s a headless browser that uses chromium.
Install puppeteer npm install puppeteer Scrape Google Search using Puppeteer First, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the google homepage, type something in, and click the search button.

      <description>Up until graduation day, everything made sense. I&amp;rsquo;ll go to class, get good grades, then land a decent paying job so that I can move out of my parents and &amp;ldquo;start my life&amp;rdquo;. Amazingly, all of that happened fresh out of college at 22 years old. Back then, a couple of my peers have told me, &amp;ldquo;Damn dude, you&amp;rsquo;re living the dream.&amp;rdquo; In reality, I felt like I was far from it.</description>

      <description>I recently had the &amp;ldquo;amazing ðŸ™„&amp;rdquo; opportunity to spend two weeks figuring out how to install hyperledger fabric on Kubernetes. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many guides on the internet besides this one. Unfortunately, I found it to be very vague and missing some keys steps.
For this tutorial, let&amp;rsquo;s go step-by-step on how to install hyperledger on kubernetes. We are going to use some information from the guide linked above, along with some stuff my team and I were able to figure out along the way.</description>

      <description>When I start working on a side project, I fall into a really bad habit of getting too absorbed in it. The second I get home from work, I will start coding and testing for hours until I have to force myself to go to bed with only six hours of sleep at best. All the while, my laundry starts to pile up, my kitchen doesn&amp;rsquo;t get cleaned, and my social contacts get neglected from any meaningful conversation.</description>

      <title>Why I Switched From WordPress to Hugo</title>

      <description>WordPress isn&amp;rsquo;t awful. In fact, I recommend WordPress to everyone who wants to start a blog. Despite this, I switched from WordPress to Hugo a couple of weeks ago. The real reason came down to cost and simplicity.
Cost Running a WordPress blog meant that I needed a good shared hosting environment with a MySQL server and PHP execution. I first tried Hostgator, and it was sufficient enough while my blog had less than a hundred of visitors per month.</description>

      <description>I am beginning to see the relationship between happiness, anticipation and dopamine.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for reward-driven behavior and pleasure seeking. (Psychology Today). When we get a hit of dopamine, we feel good!
Anticipation is the simple act of looking forward; usually to a pleasurable experience but it could also be negative.
In my previous post about Proven Ways to be Happy Again, I mentioned this thing called hedonic adaptation.</description>

      <description>During the winter holidays (peek depression season), I took a free online course called The Science of Well-Being offered by Yale University. It was actually recommended in a HackerNews comment that I came across in a thread about different MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) to take.
Other than my obsession with self help porn, I took this course because I wanted to learn on how to be happy again with life.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back I was working on a project where I needed to read system environment in Angular 7 from a Docker container before it builds. After days of searching, I came across a solution from multiple sources on the internet.
Keep one thing in mind, you will only be able to inject environment variables before your Angular app builds. Unlike Nodejs, you will not get real time access because you are running in an browser environment.</description>

      <description>Setting up search on your static site built using Hugo or Jekyll is not as difficult as it sounds. If your static site is hosted on GitHub pages (which mine currently is), then you will not be able to use php or any server side scripting. Therefore, we must rely on a pure javascript solution.
Using Lunr.js Lunr is a popular library used to parse through data and return the most accurate match based on a search query.</description>

      <description>If you are trying to be more social, consider investing in traditional books over EBooks. I know this sounds crazy, and no, Amazon did not pay me to say this.
Ebooks are missing an important aspect that we have always took for granted in traditional book. There is no easily visible cover! This means people have no idea on what you&amp;rsquo;re reading. With traditional books, its out in the open for everyone to see.</description>

If you try to download a video from youtube, you have to use one of the ad-infested free YouTube video downloaders. Other sites like Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr are even harder to find downloaders for. Luckily, there is a free and open-source program that will end your struggles and help you download and video from any site for free.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, Windows 10 comes with a lot of bloatware pre-installed on it. Things like Candy crash, Bing Weather, Bing Sports, etc. If you really wanted to, you could go through the programs and features tool and remove each app individually. However, that would take a lot of unnecessary time and some apps wouldn&amp;#8217;t show up in that menu. To overcome this challenge, a user on GitHub created aÂ Windows 10 bloatware removal script that uses PowerShell to remove the unnecessary apps.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#8217;s not romanticize imperfection. The Pixel 3 is notÂ _The Little Engine That Could,Â _or some gifted boy who was born without legs. There are people out there who treat Google like the underdog; despite the fact that they have full control over the future of Android. And while there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having favorites in a race, it can be dangerous to idolize a runner just based off his shoes.</description>

Unfortunately, my network access only allowed me to have one device at a time on the network. This was a huge pain because I wanted to connect both my phone and laptop to the network. After some searching, I found out a simple way to share wifi from an android device.</description>

      <description>There is an easy way that you can control one Android device from another Android device. This is useful if you need to perform any type of tech support for someone else&amp;#8217;s device. To control Android from Android we can use the free app TeamViewer Quick Support.
Compatibility: This is not compatible with every Android device. TeamViewer has a full list of the supported manufacturers. Unfortunately, if you have a Google Pixel device then you will not be able to take advantage of the remote control capabilities; you will only be able to share your screen.</description>

      <description>The Windows 10 April update brought a lot of new features. One of the little-known features is a new power plan called ultimate performance mode. According to Microsoft, this mode decreases the micro-latency between the OS and the hardware. Exactly what that means, I&amp;#8217;m not too sure. However, this mode is more than just made up fluff.
I ran a couple of benchmarks between using the default balanced mode on my PC and the ultimate performance mode.</description>

      <description>The JSON Web Token (JWT) is the easiest standard for protecting APIs and passing in claims data. A JSON Web token allows the server to verify the authenticity of the user and provide them access to protected API routes and data.&amp;nbsp; A simple JWT flow goes as follows:
 The user sends login credentials to the server The server verifies user against&amp;nbsp;the database then returns a JWT token if valid The user sends that token in the header with every request to API.</description>

      <description>There are many opinionated solutions for building a React Login with Google Firebase. I generally prefer an approach where the user isn&amp;#8217;t shown the main UI until he is logged in. And if the user logs out, we immediately kick him back to the login screen. Luckily, this isn&amp;#8217;t hard to do at all.
Dependencies The only dependency you will need is the Firebase API. You can install this form the Node Package Manager.</description>

      <description>Chrome extensionsÂ are really cool. They allow the user to extend the capabilities of their browser and can incorporate really well into existing apps. So let&amp;#8217;s take a look at how to build a Chrome Extension in less than 10 minutes. Chrome Extensions are written in Javascript, so I recommend that you have a basic understanding of Javascript before proceeding with this tutorial.
What we&amp;#8217;re building We are going to build a simple chrome extension that will allow you to search google for any text that you highlight on a page.</description>

      <description>Stop saying that blockchain and decentralizing everything will fix the Internet. There has been a lot of news around Cambridge Analytica abusing Facebook profile data, and Facebook for mining user data without explicit permission. Yes, I agree that these are very bad things that need to be addressed. And I also agree that while Facebook is at the front-lines of this digital privacy war, we could also blame many other companies like Google, Twitter, Amazon, etc for similar practices.</description>

      <description>I have spent hours trying to figure out how to actually use the React Native Stacknavigator to navigate between screens. All the tutorials and guides seem to be missing important information, and the official React Native documentation is truly lacking in substance. So I want to save you some headache and give you a quick and easy setup to using the React Native StackNavigator.

      <description>Google has been working on an interesting project called Poly. With Poly, you have access to hundreds of 3D objects that can be used to build VR games or with AR content. The interesting about Poly is that all of the graphics are available on demand. Think of it like Google Fonts just for 3D objects. So let&amp;#8217;s take a look at how you can get started with Google Poly API Javascript and NodeJS bundle.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure you have probably heard of the fancy new React Context API. It&amp;#8217;s a new way for you to manage application state. If you are building a large react application, you have probably encountered a problem where you needed to access and share data across multipleÂ components. For example, we might have information on the currently authenticated user that multiple components need information on. To solve this issue, you might use a library like Redux or Mobx.</description>

      <guid>https://www.bennettnotes.com/react-native-android-receive-data-from-share-intent/</guid>
      <description>This whole problem started when I was working with an app in React Native. I wanted the app to be able to open when it received data from another app through the &amp;#8220;share with&amp;#8221; intent. For example, if I share an URL through the YouTube app, I wanted my app to be recognized as one of the apps that could handle the URL and open it.
I am going to spoil the fun and tell you that there&amp;#8217;s no easy way to do it straight through javascript with React Native.</description>

      <description>This is something that you probably don&amp;#8217;t ever think about, but getters and setters are implicit on every javascript object. For example, if we take the following:
person = {}; person.name = &#39;Dave&#39; //uses the implicit setter on the object console.log(person.name) //uses the implicit getter The above code is something that you have probably have seen very often in javascript. However, this doesn&amp;#8217;t give you much control over how properties are accessed or defined.</description>

      <description>I was working on a project in Angular 4 and needed to implement input fields that only accept numerical values. My first thought was to simply add the HTML5Â type=&amp;#8221;number&amp;#8221; to the input. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#8217;t supported in Internet Explorer 10 and some of the clients would most likely be using Internet Explorer 10. My only other option was to implement a directive. Thanks to this StackOverflowÂ answer, I was able to modify it to my needs.</description>

Luckily, implementing token interceptor and retry in Angular 4 and beyond is very easy thanks to the new HTTP Interceptors. Using this, we can add an authorization header to every outbound request while also implementing a retry mechanism for requests that fail due to an expired token.</description>

      <description>A user on GitHub just posted an alarming exploit shows how a simple CSSÂ hack can steal internet passwords. It&amp;#8217;s kinda funny how you wouldn&amp;#8217;t really think of CSS when it comes to vulnerabilities and hacking. Since CSS is only used to style a webpage, its threat level is generally considered to be relatively low.
However, CSS does provide developers with very advanced selectors. In this case, if you wanted to select an input with the value of A in it and turn it red, then CSS allows you to do that.</description>

Now let&amp;#8217;s say that you wanted to build your own online forum. Well, building a very basic forum wouldn&amp;#8217;t be too complicated. Just script together some PHP with an MYSQL database and you will be all set. Unfortunately, this would likely leave you vulnerable to many potential security holes and a terrible user experience.</description>

Intel is struggling to get their Meltdown bug under control while Amazon and Microsoft brutallyÂ await its impact on their cloud services. Both Meltdown and Spectre are serious issues, but Meltdown is easier to exploit and gives attackers more valuable information.</description>

      <description>Bootstrap is an amazing library and worksÂ wonders with ReactJS. Unfortunately, you can&amp;#8217;t (or really shouldn&amp;#8217;t) use Bootstrap.js with React because bootstrap directly manipulates the DOM; which could break React&amp;#8217;s nice rendering flow. This becomes a big problem if you wanted to implement a Navbar using plain bootstrap. Take the following for example from Bootstrap&amp;#8217;s documentation:
&amp;nbsp;
You could directly take this code and put it in ReactJS (but changeÂ classÂ _toÂ _className) and you will have a working Navbar.</description>

For the brave, here&amp;#8217;s how to install Linux on Surface Laptop the more traditional way.
Be Careful!Â Once we change the boot configuration on your Surface Laptop, you will need to enter your recovery key to unlock your hard drive (which is locked by BitLocker by default).</description>

      <description>If you are new to Javascript (or even a seasoned js developer), you will probably get confused when trying to understand the different types of for loops. So let&amp;#8217;s go through the javascript for of vs for in vs for each loop.
Standard for loop Suppose we have an array called myArray. Here&amp;#8217;s how you would iterate through it using the standard for loop:
var myArray = [&#39;Cat&#39;,&#39;Dog&#39;,&#39;Horse&#39;]; for(let i =0; i&amp;lt; myArray.</description>

      <description>If you want to subscribe to variable change in Angular 4 service or Angular 5 service, you can use something called theÂ BehaviorSubject from the rxjsÂ library. A behavior subject is like an observable, except that it must be created with an initial value as it is must always return a value even if the subject hasn&amp;#8217;t been updated. A behavior subject will always emit it&amp;#8217;s first value as soon as it&amp;#8217;s described.</description>

      <description>When I was trying to install Ubuntu I experienced a very strange issue. The Ubuntu install hangs on splash screen for a very long time. I would select the option toÂ try Ubuntu in the grub menu, and then I would get this strange screen with broken graphics. It looked like the graphics failed to load or something. The Ubuntu install freezes on that screen and would not advance.
I eventually found out that this issue will occur if you are using an Nvidia Graphics card.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will take a look at how to build a multiplayer game using Javascript and NodeJS. My goal is to take you through the basic setup so that you can begin focusing on the actual gameplay. When building a full-scale MMO, there are a lot of things to consider like load balancing, network contingencies, etc. For now, we are going to focus on the bare minimumÂ just to help you get an understanding of how you can creatively and effectively use the available tools of NodeJS to get started.</description>

      <description>Suppose that you developed an app that will give users free stuff when they click a button. Obviously, there&amp;#8217;s nothing stopping one user from spamming the button one million times and collecting a whole bunch of free stuff. If you wanted to prevent that, you could use something like a CAPTCHA, or perhaps give each user a session and cool off period. You could also implement something called a proof of work system.</description>

At its core, the basic concept of blockchain is not hard to understand; it&amp;#8217;s essentially a distributed linked list. It&amp;#8217;s also used by the popular cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. The advantages of Blockchain is that it allows for a decentralized collection of data whose integrity is easily verifiable, and the data itself is immutable Keep in mind that a fully robust blockchain will also contain smart contracts, mining algorithmsÂ (proof of work/proof of stake) and other flavorful elements that you could enhance the chain with.</description>

      <description>The Google Pixel 2 XL and the Galaxy Note 8 are two excellent devices. They are so good, that I would be lying if I told you that it was easy to make a decision between these two devices. Deciding which one to buy is going to come down to a lot of personal preference and trivial differences. So let&amp;#8217;s do a comparison of the Google Pixel 2 XL vs Galaxy Note 8.</description>

      <description>If you are building a large single page application, there might come a time when you will need to add routesÂ toÂ different pages. Unlike traditional routes, adding routes in ReactJS does not trigger a page reload. This makes your SPA extremely fast and feels more like an actual application rather than a simple website. To navigate in ReactJS we will be using the React v4 router.
Setting Up React V4 Router Begin by installing the React V4 Router from npm:</description>

In the past, I demonstrated how to Run Kali Linux on Android (version 1.0) via the terminal. Now let&amp;#8217;s take a look at how to run Kali Linux 2 on Android without root. To do this, we will be using Limbo PC Emulator. It makes use of the SDL library to emulate Kali Linux 2 on Android.</description>

      <description>For the longest time, Javascript has always been implemented using a single thread in your browser. For the most part, this wasn&amp;#8217;t a problem. If you&amp;#8217;re just using javascript for simple DOM manipulations or form submissions then a single thread is all you need. However, once developers started getting more advanced with their Javascript usage, this eventually led to an issue.
Let&amp;#8217;s say I have the following single page application (SPA) that shows a list of prime numbers from 1 to 600,000:</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a good chance that you don&amp;#8217;t think of JavaScript when you think of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Instead, youÂ might think of Python and popular libraries like Google&amp;#8217;s Tensorflow.Â While TensorFlow is very powerful and complex, it does require a steep learning curve. Personally, I&amp;#8217;m just looking to get my feet wet in some simple AI programming. However, I came across a javascript library called Brain.js.

      <description>By default, Windows compresses your desktop wallpaper by up to 85% of its original quality. This is done to maximize performance because most people don&amp;#8217;t need a 50 MB image eating up precious RAM. There are two methods that you can use to stop Windows from compressing wallpapers. The first (unconfirmed) method is to use a PNG image file. There have been some reports that on the latest Windows 10 Creator&amp;#8217;s update, PNG images are immune to Windows compression.</description>

Unfortunately, not every app comes with a dark theme option. So if you want to dark theme any app on your device you will need to use the theme engine called Substratum. Substratum could give you a dark theme Instagram, dark them Facebook, dark theme Inbox, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://www.bennettnotes.com/javascript-callbacks/</guid>
      <description>In Javascript, a callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument. This allows you to invoke that function with a return value. Remember, Javascript&amp;#8217;s implementation within a browser is single threaded (well..until recently at least). That means that all of your code is executed within one linear operation. However, there are some functions in Javascript which are asynchronous. That means that they have the privilege to be invoked anywhere in that line of execution.</description>

      <description>Overclock Chromebook? It sounds like something that should be impossible to do. However, with the power of Linux, everything is possible. The Chromebook doesn&amp;#8217;t have the typical bios that you would find on a standard PC. Therefore, you can&amp;#8217;t easily change the CPU frequency. Using Linux, we can achieve a software FSB overclock or underclock. For this tutorial, let&amp;#8217;s focus on underclocking because that&amp;#8217;s the easier thing to do (damn that click bait).</description>

Some devices can&amp;#8217;t even play 1440p YouTube videos despite having the appropriate screen resolution. Luckily, there is a simple trick that you can do to get a higher resolution format via the YouTube app on yourÂ phone, even if your screen resolution is not 4k.

      <description>For less than $10, you can have an Android WiFI Jammer up and running. To get started, you are going to need to have the NodeMCU. It&amp;#8217;s a WiFI development chip that&amp;#8217;s usually used in Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects. However, the chip can also be used as a standalone device (it has its own CPU and memory) as long as you give it sufficient power. This means you can power it through another Android phone, your computer, power bank or any device that&amp;#8217;s capable of supplying power over USB.</description>

      <description>Here are 5 actually cool Android tricks that you can try on your device. A couple of these tricks will require that you have adbÂ installed on your computer.Â None of these tricks require root.
Hide Soft Keys Softkeys are usually convenient to have but can eat up precious screen real estate.Â Unfortunately, not many android developers give users to ability to use their app in immersive mode (which autohides the softkeys).</description>

      <description>One of the reasons that I purchased a Raspberry Pi was so that I can do local website development. Of course, I could have easily set this all up with Windows, but my desktop is already cluttered enough. And with a Raspberry Pi Webserver, I can set up scipts to run independently of my desktop. Here&amp;#8217;s how to setup a Raspberry Pi Webserver
What You Will Need:  Raspberry Pi  Setup Static IP Address It would be very annoying to have a website that always changes its address.</description>

      <description>One of the first things you should do when setting up the Raspberry Pi is to change the default password for the pi user. Personally, I would rather just delete the user altogether and create my own user. So here&amp;#8217;s how I deleted the Pi user on Raspberry Pi.
Make sure that you backup any important data from your Pi user that you might need.  Step 1: Create a New User Before you begin, make sure that you can SSH into your Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t like when OEM Skins change the Android Navbar Color. I like the Android Navbar color to always be black. It goes well with most apps and is easy on the eyes at night. Unfortunately, LG made the default color an ugly off white/gray. Using an app called Navbar apps, you can change the Android navigation bar color.

ADB allows you to access your Android phone via USB and issue commands to it.

The real reason for this was because I decided to give Jekyll a try and itÂ was going to be my replacement for WordPress, but I digress. AnotherÂ major reason to dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu was so that I could keep all of my Android development and Web development stuff within Ubuntu and use Windows solely for video editing and gaming.</description>

      <description>Here is my pick for top 7 Android apps for March 2017.
Energy Bar No this is not a snack. This app will display your battery level as a small line above your status bar. You can adjust the thickness and position of the line. At first it&amp;#8217;s kinda distracting to look at, however, I&amp;#8217;m quickly getting used it; I just love how subtle it is. I also think it&amp;#8217;s easier to estimate my battery using this rather than looking at the battery icon in the status bar.</description>

      <description>If you are looking for something cool to try, then download Eva Facial Mouse. This app allows you to control your android phone using your face. Using your face as an anchor point, the app moves the cursor on your phone relative to that point. Essentially, you are using your face to control the mouse pointer. While this is not something you should use in a practical setup, it&amp;#8217;s still a cool app to show off to your friends.</description>

So while you might not be able to play Fallout 4 on android, there is nothing stopping you from streaming it to your device. Here&amp;#8217;s how you can Stream Steams Games to Android.

It features a high-quality aluminumÂ design with a crisp 400 x 400 AMOLEDÂ display. There&amp;#8217;s even a speaker so that you can make phone calls and listen to music right from the watch. The only two things that I don&amp;#8217;t like about this watch is the weak vibration motor and the annoying pin charging mechanism.</description>

      <description>There are three routes that you can take when setting up a VPN. You can either use a free one, buy a paid service or make your own. The advantage of free VPNs is that they are easy to setup; just install and they are ready to be used. My favorite VPN on Android is Opera VPN. The downside of Free VPNs is that they typically come withÂ a 500 &amp;#8211; 1GB data cap and are very slow.</description>

      <description>Battery life on Android is a nightmareÂ to deal with unless you know exactly what to look for. Android&amp;#8217;s vague battery statistics can be frustrating for a novice and seasoned user alike. For example, a battery drain labeled as Android System could be Google Play Services performing something in the background, or the Facebook app using the camera, or any other app that makes any API call. And speaking of Facebook, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of conflicting research and anecdotalÂ reports on whether the app is responsible for any sort of excessive battery drain.</description>

      <description>As you know, Microsoft Cortana has become an integral part of Windows 10. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind Cortana so much if Microsoft didn&amp;#8217;t force it upon us. One thing which really bothers me about Cortana is that it defaults to Microsoft Edge and Bing. I am a Google person, so I would prefer if it used Google Search and Google Chrome. Before the Windows 10 Anniversary update, there used to be a way to change the default behavior.</description>

      <description>Does your workstation setup contain more than one computer? I have my main desktop along with my surface setting in front of my at all times. I sometimes hate that I have to reach across my desk and switch between keyboards to type something. Luckily, USB sharing between the two devices is not difficult. Thanks to a garage app by Microsoft, you can control multiple computers with one mouse and keyboard very easily.</description>

      <description>Although the PlayStation 4 is the latest console fromÂ Sony, the PlayStation 3 is still a popular game system that is enjoyed by many. One group of developers have been actively working to bring the PlayStation 3 experience to your PC. RPCS3 is an open source PlayStationÂ 3 emulator. The emulator is still in early alpha stages, so don&amp;#8217;t expect many commercial titles to be compatible. It works well with homebrew games and games which do not require advanced 3D graphics.</description>

Needless to say, you can use your Android device as a microphone. There are two ways that this canÂ be accomplished. The first is through traditional cables, and the second is through additional software. If you want to use your Android device as a microphone through USB, Wifi or Bluetooth, then skip to the second method.</description>

This is not through a virtual machine nor container, but a subsystem that they previously added in an earlier Windows update. Here&amp;#8217;s how you can enable Linux in Windows 10:

      <description>Having more than one monitor is useful for any power user (porn on one, games on another). SoÂ it&amp;#8217;s possible to use an android device as a secondary monitor, but I recommend actually buying one if you want an easy setup. With that said, if you have a spare Android device laying around, you can use it as another monitor in your setup. To do this, we are going to use Windows and &amp;#8220;trick&amp;#8221; it into thinking that you have another monitor connected and then use TeamViewer to access the &amp;#8220;fake&amp;#8221; monitor.</description>

      <description>I have received many requests to do a video of League on Chromebook. Well, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too surprising that it works. All it takes is running Windows on your Chromebook. The biggest limitation that I face was the insufficient hard drive space on my Chromebook (Acer C720). To solve that issue, I installed League to a flash drive. Of course, this had a negative effect on the game&amp;#8217;s load time.</description>

      <description>Every year, smartphones get better and better. We live in the age where the average smartphone has better specs than a two year old computer. Despite all of this technological innovation, battery life is still a major concern for many consumers. It&amp;#8217;s simple, we need longer lasting batteries. Unfortunately, until there is a scientific breakthrough with battery technology, this is unlikely to change. Fortunately, there is a way that you can get the most out of your battery.</description>

To do this you will need to have a rooted Android device. The process for this is fairly simple. We need to findÂ the location of the desired attribute then change its value.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe I&amp;#8217;m saying it, but you can run Windows 7 on your Android device. To be honest,Â I was convinced that running Windows XP on Android would be the final stepÂ in Windows emulation, but I was wrong. Before you get too excited about playing the latest AAA titleÂ on your phone, keep in mind that this is nothing further than a proof of concept. The performance is painfully sluggish and the app might crash if Windows startsÂ using too much memory.</description>

      <description>So I had some leftover Fallout 4 footage lying around and I came across Lune by NCS. I feel like this song would be the perfect soundtrack for this game. So here&amp;#8217;s a short video montage of a few action shots.</description>

How would you like to play one of the most popular PC games of all time on your Android device? So, maybe playing Half-Life 2 and Team-Fortress classicÂ on Android isn&amp;#8217;t cool enough for you. Well, how about Counter Strike on Android? Of course, this isn&amp;#8217;t going to be the latest Counter Strike Global Offensive with the Source Engine. It&amp;#8217;s going to be the old school original counter strike from the late 90s.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re not using a VPN, you should consider using one. A Virtual Private Network (VPN)Â extends a private network across a public network. This gives you an added layer of security and privacy. Imagine if you are sitting at a Starbucks on their free public WiFi. Well, someone could have a program such as Wireshark or any other application open and sniff traffic across the network. Potentially, information such as usernames, passwords and other sensitive data could be exposed.</description>

      <description>I always get a lot of questions asking for instructions on how to root a particular device. Unfortunately, the root exploit that worked on one device might now work on another. This usually means that the user will have to spend hours searching for a method to root their device. This tasks becomes even more challenging if their device from a little known company without a development community.</description>

Now keep in mind, you aren&amp;#8217;t going to be able to do anything intensive on this. This is more a proof concept (like a lot of things that I do) and something just to admire.
To do this, we are going to be doing some very convoluted emulation.</description>

      <description>I really wish more people used WOL. It is probably one of the most underrated things in the world of wired networking. If you aren&amp;#8217;t familiar, WOL (Wake on Lan) allows you to remotely turn on your computer. This could be from another computer or even your Android device. It works by supplying a little bit of power to your Ethernet card to allow it to listen for the &amp;#8220;wake up&amp;#8221; signal.</description>

      <description>Fallout 4 has been one of my favorite games of the year, but it isn&amp;#8217;t perfect. Everyone is aware how&amp;#8230;lacking&amp;#8230; Bethesda can be with their games. However, thanks to the modding community, many of the issues that you might encounter in Fallout 4 can be fixed.
One of the biggest complaints about Fallout 4 has been the FPS lock and not supporting 21:9 widescreen monitors. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling adventurous, you can dig through the game&amp;#8217;s ini file and adjust the values accordingly, but the easier solution would be to download the Fallout 4 Configuration toolÂ which allows to you use a simple GUI that will makeÂ Fallout 4 tweaks.</description>

      <description>Do you want to get the fastest speed available on your Android device? Sure, LTE is fast and all but you&amp;#8217;re hit with really small data caps. WiFi doesn&amp;#8217;t impose the same limitations, but the speed is never consistent. So why not just connect Android to Ethernet?
Luckily, Android Marshmallow comes to the rescue. Android Marshmallow introduces new drivers that allow you to connect your Android device directly to an Ethernet cable without needingÂ root!</description>

      <description>Hopefully it is clear by now that Chromebooks are not meant for gaming of any type. However, that hasn&amp;#8217;t stopped many of you from accomplishing things like playing CS:GO on your Chromebook or PS2 Games. However, games like CS:GO and TF2 will work on almost any piece of hardware, but something like Fallout 4 won&amp;#8217;t.
If you&amp;#8217;re still determined to game from your Chromebook, you can do so via streaming.</description>

      <description>Everyone loves those new iOS emojis. One annoying thing about dealing with emojis is that they look different on every platform. Android has the green blobs while ios has the yellow faces.
In any case, getting the new ios 90 emojis on your Android device is not that difficult, provided that you haveÂ a rooted Android device. Keep in mind though, this will only allow you to receive and interpret ios emojis on your device (so no more boxes with X&amp;#8217;s in them when you receive an emoji from your ios friend) but you will not be able to send the new emojis.</description>

      <description>One of the best things about Android is that there are a lot of emulators for the platform. You can play games from the PS2, Nintendo DS, PSP, etc. No other mobile platform comes close to the same amount of emulation apps. With that said, one popular emulator that has been lurking around for quite some time is the Dolphin Emulator. It&amp;#8217;s capable of emulating GameCube and Wii games.</description>

If you are lucky enough to own an Nvidia Tegra device (such as the Shield) then you can completely ignore this tutorial because it doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to you. Half Life 2 exists as an exclusive for Nvidia&amp;#8217;s Shield device. Unfortunately, not everyone owns a device that is running the Tegra cpu. Luckily, using the app GlTools, you can emulate the Tegra graphics driver on your device.</description>

      <description>League players are everywhere. Sure, the majority of them are PC users, but there&amp;#8217;s a growing population of Linux gamers out there who want in on the action. Thanks to the program Play On Linux, which makes use of Wine (a popular program that allows many Windows applications to run on Linux), anyone can play League on their alinux computer.
I should also add that this procedure will also work on an x86 Chromebook with Crouton installed.</description>

      <description>I recently came to the realization that Chrome OS is in some ways a perfect operating system. No, I swear I&amp;#8217;m not taking any hallucinogens. Here is a scenario that really opened my mind. I have an aunt who uses a basic low spec PC running Windows XP. All she does is check her email and check Facebook once per day, and that&amp;#8217;s it. Unfortunately, her PC barely meets the requirements to run Windows XP effectively and is constantly cluttered from maleware, Trojans, etc.</description>

      <description>I will be the first to admit that I prefer Windows over Mac OS any day. Besides being a slight Microsoft fanboy, I do prefer Windows because it meets all of my software and gaming needs, but I digress. In any case, there are still some unfortunate situations when I need to have access to Mac OS.
Luckily, I&amp;#8217;ll show you an easy way on how to install Mac OS X Yosemite on any pc, regardless of the hardware that you currently have installed (even if it is an AMD CPU).</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re looking for an ultra portable solution for your computing lifestyle, you might be interested in running Windows 10 from USB. It&amp;#8217;s a good solution if you do light work on multiple computers. Now clearly, this is not the most ideal situation. For one, this will surely shortness the life cycle of your USB with the numerous reads and writes it&amp;#8217;ll have to perform. Also, USB speed is much slower than SATA speed.</description>

      <description>Just because you can, doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you should. But in this case, you totally should. If you recall, I demonstrated how to play Team Fortress Classic on Android using the SDLash app. The app is able to emulate the GoldSource game engine, which was used in many of the classic valveÂ games such as Half-Life and Team Fortress. Right now, I am putting together a tutorial on how to playÂ Half-life on Android, but in the meantime, check out how to do it on Android Wear (albeit a little more complicated).</description>

      <description>So do you have a Chromebook sitting around that you have absolutely no idea what to do with? Well, if you or your buddies are minecraft junkies, then why not consider turning your Chromebook into a Minecraft server. It runs slightly faster than using your Android phone as a minecraft server, and offers a playable speed(though it can lag occasionally).
Now before you do this, you need to make sure that you haveÂ Ubuntu Installed on your Chromebook.</description>

      <description>Have you ever imagined that you would be able to play a Steam game on your phone? Well, I hope so, because I already demonstrated how to play Portal on your Android device. In any case, it&amp;#8217;s even easier to play Team Fortress Classic on Android. This is all thanks to an app called SDLash3D which uses the SDL library that allows you to do some really cool emulation such as running Windows 95 on your device.</description>

      <description>Do you have an old computer just sitting around? If you are like me, then you probably have a couple of old PC&amp;#8217;s that once ran Windows XP but serve no usefulÂ purpose now.Â Of course, I could always just install and very lite version of Linux on it and call it a day. However, Linux takes a lot of time (compared to Windows) to set up and is a big learning curve for people who are unfamiliar with it.</description>

      <description>Security means everything to me. I am that guy who uses two step authentication on everything, along with safety backups and more. When it comes to security on Android, things aren&amp;#8217;t as tight as I would like them to be. On my S6, my favorite thing to use is the fingerprint scanner. I am aware that the fingerprint scanner does not offer better security than a strong password or lock pattern (although you could easily bypass the Android Lockscreen pattern), however, it will deter most people fromÂ trying to snoop around in my phone.</description>

I am talking about an actual app with the purpose of emulating the PlayStation 2. Now don&amp;#8217;t get too excited. This app is still in the very early stages.

However, it&amp;#8217;s been about nine years since I have last played the game, so I am very behind on the latest additions and enhancements. In any case, if you are an active player, you will be happy to know that you can play this on your Chromebook.</description>

There are so many old titles that I used to love playing. And those cartridges&amp;#8230;damn&amp;#8230;I loved those cartridges. The best thing was that there used to be a huge bin at stores like GameStop, where I could easily pick up a bunch of them for under $10.</description>

What is even more astonishing is how outdated technology can easily become to us within a small amount of time.</description>

You could be banned from hosting certain content and companies could easily sort through what you are uploading and create targeted ads based on it.</description>

In this video, I use the built in slow motion editor. Of course, a much better way would have been to record the video in 60fps then slow it down in Adobe Premiere.</description>

Well, with a little help from Linux and Steam you can play CS:Go on your Chromebook. Of course, this will only work with the Intel powered Chromebooks. As far as performance, it&amp;#8217;s playable. On average, I am getting around 23-30 fps in games. It&amp;#8217;s nowhere close to the performance that I get on my desktop, but is still playable none the less.</description>

Whatever your situation may be, I am here to inform you that you can run Windows 10 on your Chromebook. Yes, I am talking about a complete and nearly functional version of Windows 10. In my quick time of using it, I was able to download and play League of Legends (unbearable frame rate though) watch a couple of YouTube videos and useÂ a few lightweight programs.</description>

      <description>Yes, you can run Windows 10 on a Chromebook! Now this should not come as too much of a surprise because Chromebooks are pretty much low powered laptops with Chrome OS installed. In addition, Windows 10 is designedÂ to work with devices with lower end specifications. Overall, the performance was fluid. Between browsing through the start menu and opening up Internet Explorer, I did not encounter any issues.
There are some technical things to mention.</description>

      <description>Would you only buy a Galaxy or iPhone?   So the other day, I was chatting with my friend about new smartphones. He currently owns the Galaxy S5 and was thinking about either upgrading to the Galaxy S6 or the iPhone. I jokingly informed him that there are other Android smartphone manufacturers such as HTC, LG, Motorola, etc. However he told me, &amp;#8220;Dave, honestly, unless it&amp;#8217;s a Galaxy or iPhone, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t consider buying it.</description>

      <description>Play PSP Games on Android Yes, you can play PSP games on your Android device. This is not a gimmick, nor some sort of absurd remote VNC. This is pure emulation right on your Android device. It is all thanks to the app PPSSPP. Surprisingly, some games work with excellent frame rate and graphics quality (Naruto for example). Keep in mind though, not every game will be compatible and it will not work with every device.</description>

If you are lucky enough to own an Nvidia Shield (or any Tegra 4 device), you already have access to the game plus more exclusives. But what if you do not own an Nvidia Shield? Well there is still a way to play Portal thanks to an app called GLTools. GLtTools will emulate the Tegra 4 drivers, so that the app thinks you are using a Tegra 4 device.</description>

First, this only works when your security is set to pattern lock. Secondly, you must have aÂ rooted android device. And finally, you need to haveÂ adb debuggingÂ enabled. I know this might only be a smallÂ percentage of people out there, so for those of you who do, here&amp;#8217;s how you can bypass Android lock screen.</description>

      <description>Adobe Flash Player Android Lollipop: At one time, Android fully supported adobe flash player. However, officialÂ support ended by the time KitKat was released (though there were still a few hacks that you could use to get it). Of course, HTML5 video players are the preferred option, but unfortunately, there are some porn sites that still rely heavily on adobe flash content.

Well, if you have an Android device running Lollipop you can now access the flash content once more.</description>

To keep it brief,Â Tor is a mesh of proxy servers that bounces your IP to different locationsÂ across the globe.</description>

Using an app called echo Lockscreen, you can get notifications on your device&amp;#8217;s lock screen. It also turns on your screen when you get a notification such as a text message; I think that&amp;#8217;s one of the major advantages to this app. Give it a try and tell me what you think about it.</description>

Luckily, Android Lollipop adds a trusted device feature that allows you to automatically disable your lock screen if you are on a trusted wifi network or connected to a trusted Bluetooth device.</description>

      <description>Yes Virginia, you can run Windows XP on your Android device. What once took cutting edge hardware to boot, can now work on your typical Android smartphone. Don&amp;#8217;t get too excited though, this will not replace your desktop pc any time soon. The emulation speed is unbearably slow, and you lack any sort of network connectivity. So how does this work? One word, Bochs. Bochs is an app that can emulate practically any 32 bit operating system.</description>

While I would consider myself part of the former group, I can admit that thereÂ are places where Chrome OS falls short of a desktop operating system. For exampling, I&amp;#8217;m not able to open a java compiler on Chrome OS or use Wine to play Steam games. However, you can do all these things on Linux.</description>

Well, he used a recently discovered exploit found in all Linux kernels that were built prior to June 3rd.

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s not surprising that certain games purposefully limit the maximum graphics level that the user could set. However, it becomes an issue when the device you&amp;#8217;re playing on is more than capable of handling the maximum graphics level, even though the developers didn&amp;#8217;t think so. Unfortunately, Dead Trigger 2 is a perfect example of this scenario. Fortunately, with a little file modification you can enable the secret &amp;#8220;ultra&amp;#8221; graphics mode only accessible to latest generation iPhones and Tegra devices.</description>

This will require a rooted android device and could run the risk of damaging your speakers if you go too high, so be warned.
