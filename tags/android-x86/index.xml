      <description>Do you have an old computer just sitting around? If you are like me, then you probably have a couple of old PC&amp;#8217;s that once ran Windows XP but serve no useful purpose now. Of course, I could always just install and very lite version of Linux on it and call it a day. However, Linux takes a lot of time (compared to Windows) to set up and is a big learning curve for people who are unfamiliar with it.</description>
