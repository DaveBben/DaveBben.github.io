Make sure that you backup any important data from your Pi user that you might need.  Step 1: Create a New User Before you begin, make sure that you can SSH into your Raspberry Pi.</description>

Introducing, the Raspberry Pi Zero W. The Raspberry Pu Zero W is the cheapest computer you can buy. This computer isn&amp;#8217;t made for gaming or bitcoin mining. It&amp;#8217;s aimed at developers and enthusiastsÂ to use in their projects. It would also make for a great setup for a small home server.</description>
