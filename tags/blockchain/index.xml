      <description>Stop saying that blockchain and decentralizing everything will fix the Internet. There has been a lot of news around Cambridge Analytica abusing Facebook profile data, and Facebook for mining user data without explicit permission. Yes, I agree that these are very bad things that need to be addressed.

      <description>Blockchain! It&amp;#8217;s the mystical buzzword that every company is saying right now. At its core, the basic concept of blockchain is not hard to understand; it&amp;#8217;s essentially a distributed linked list. It&amp;#8217;s also used by the popular cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. The advantages of Blockchain is that it allows for a decentralized collection of data whose integrity is easily verifiable, and the data itself is immutable Keep in mind that a fully robust blockchain will also contain smart contracts, mining algorithmsÂ (proof of work/proof of stake) and other flavorful elements that you could enhance the chain with.</description>
