      <description>I recently had the &amp;ldquo;amazing ðŸ™„&amp;rdquo; opportunity to spend two weeks figuring out how to install hyperledger fabric on Kubernetes. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many guides on the internet besides this one. Unfortunately, I found it to be very vague and missing some keys steps.
For this tutorial, let&amp;rsquo;s go step-by-step on how to install hyperledger on kubernetes. We are going to use some information from the guide linked above, along with some stuff my team and I were able to figure out along the way.</description>

      <description>Stop saying that blockchain and decentralizing everything will fix the Internet. There has been a lot of news around Cambridge Analytica abusing Facebook profile data, and Facebook for mining user data without explicit permission. Yes, I agree that these are very bad things that need to be addressed. And I also agree that while Facebook is at the front-lines of this digital privacy war, we could also blame many other companies like Google, Twitter, Amazon, etc for similar practices.</description>

      <description>Suppose that you developed an app that will give users free stuff when they click a button. Obviously, there&amp;#8217;s nothing stopping one user from spamming the button one million times and collecting a whole bunch of free stuff. If you wanted to prevent that, you could use something like a CAPTCHA, or perhaps give each user a session and cool off period. You could also implement something called a proof of work system.</description>

      <description>Blockchain! It&amp;#8217;s the mystical buzzword that every company is saying right now. At its core, the basic concept of blockchain is not hard to understand; it&amp;#8217;s essentially a distributed linked list. It&amp;#8217;s also used by the popular cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. The advantages of Blockchain is that it allows for a decentralized collection of data whose integrity is easily verifiable, and the data itself is immutable Keep in mind that a fully robust blockchain will also contain smart contracts, mining algorithmsÂ (proof of work/proof of stake) and other flavorful elements that you could enhance the chain with.</description>
