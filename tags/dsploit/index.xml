      <description>For less than $10, you can have an Android WiFI Jammer up and running. To get started, you are going to need to have the NodeMCU. It&amp;#8217;s a WiFI development chip that&amp;#8217;s usually used in Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects. However, the chip can also be used as a standalone device (it has its own CPU and memory) as long as you give it sufficient power. This means you can power it through another Android phone, your computer, power bank or any device that&amp;#8217;s capable of supplying power over USB.</description>

      <description>A little while ago, there was this awesome program called dSploit. It was a network security app that provided users with an abundance of tools and operations to test the strength of their network security. Recently, dSploit was merged with a proprietary closed source app that isn&amp;#8217;t free. While you can find older copies of dSploit floating around on the internet, none of them are up to date.</description>
