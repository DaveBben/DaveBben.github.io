      <description>I had just finished a YouTube that I spent a week working on; a couple of days working on the graphics, a day of voice recording, and a few more hours coming up with a nice thumbnail. I uploaded it, and eagerly awaited the YouTube algorithm to award my quality work with a burst of views and watch time. I sat and waited in anticipation. Hour one went by, nothing. Okay, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a little slow today.</description>

Essentially, we are going to add a line to the build prop that &amp;#8220;tricks&amp;#8221; the YouTube app into thinking you have a different display size.</description>
