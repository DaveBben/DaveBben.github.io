      <description>Does your workstation setup contain more than one computer? I have my main desktop along with my surface setting in front of my at all times. I sometimes hate that I have to reach across my desk and switch between keyboards to type something. Luckily, USB sharing between the two devices is not difficult. Thanks to a garage app by Microsoft, you can control multiple computers with one mouse and keyboard very easily.</description>

      <description>Having more than one monitor is useful for any power user (porn on one, games on another). SoÂ it&amp;#8217;s possible to use an android device as a secondary monitor, but I recommend actually buying one if you want an easy setup. With that said, if you have a spare Android device laying around, you can use it as another monitor in your setup. To do this, we are going to use Windows and &amp;#8220;trick&amp;#8221; it into thinking that you have another monitor connected and then use TeamViewer to access the &amp;#8220;fake&amp;#8221; monitor.</description>
