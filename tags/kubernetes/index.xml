      <description>The team and I were searching for solutions that enabled us to secure the communication between the microservices that we have running in our Rancher cluster. Our first application consisted of a set of services that essentially performed CRUD operations using the typical RESTful architecture (GET, POST, PUT, etc).
We decided to use Istio because it offered a compelling solution that incorporated the use of mTLS (mutual TLS authentication). For us, this meant that we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to manage certificates ourselves our worry about the individual TLS implementation of each service in its respective language.</description>

      <description>I recently had the &amp;ldquo;amazing ðŸ™„&amp;rdquo; opportunity to spend two weeks figuring out how to install hyperledger fabric on Kubernetes. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many guides on the internet besides this one. Unfortunately, I found it to be very vague and missing some keys steps.
For this tutorial, let&amp;rsquo;s go step-by-step on how to install hyperledger on kubernetes. We are going to use some information from the guide linked above, along with some stuff my team and I were able to figure out along the way.</description>
