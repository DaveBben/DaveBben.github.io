      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think that I have ever encountered anyone who said that they like ads (other than maybe the Super Bowl ads). Nonetheless, ads are a necessary evil which must be tolerated in order to compensate for various internet endeavors. However, there are many apps, games, and websites which abuse ads and destroy the entire experience. In the past, blocking ads from these apps required that you root your device.</description>

      <description>This video is different that my usual content. In light of recent events, I wanted to highlight some of the concerns of privacy that is being challenged through companies and congress. I don&amp;#8217;t want to persuade you either way, but I just want to make you an informed consumer as to what&amp;#8217;s going on.

      <description>There are three routes that you can take when setting up a VPN. You can either use a free one, buy a paid service or make your own. The advantage of free VPNs is that they are easy to setup; just install and they are ready to be used. My favorite VPN on Android is Opera VPN. The downside of Free VPNs is that they typically come with a 500 &amp;#8211; 1GB data cap and are very slow.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re not using a VPN, you should consider using one. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network. This gives you an added layer of security and privacy. Imagine if you are sitting at a Starbucks on their free public WiFi. Well, someone could have a program such as Wireshark or any other application open and sniff traffic across the network. Potentially, information such as usernames, passwords and other sensitive data could be exposed.</description>
