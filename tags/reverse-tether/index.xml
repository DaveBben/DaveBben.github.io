      <description>My friend and I decided to have a small LAN gaming session the other day. There was just one problem, he didn&amp;#8217;t have a wireless adapter for his PC. Luckily, I had my Windows Surface on me and was able to share my internet through that (with the help of this USB Ethernet dongle) to my friend&amp;#8217;s PC.
To share your internet in Windows, you will need to make sure that you have a device that has an active wireless connection along with an Ethernet port.</description>
