      <description>Kodi on Firestick? Kodi (formerly XMBC) is a very popular platform for video entertainment that is designed to work on almost all operating systems. Previously, I shown how you can get Kodi on the Chromebook. You can also install Kodi on Android and Windows. For this tutorial, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at how to install Kodi on the Amazon Firestick.
The Easy Way: If you have an Android device, do yourself a favor and use this method.</description>

      <description>Slow Motion seems to be all the rage these days. Every one is trying to do it. It should come as no surprise that the Galaxy S6 also features this. While the Galaxy S6 slow motion video capabilities don&amp;#8217;t exactly rival those of the iPhone, it&amp;#8217;s still pretty good in its own right. In this video, I use the built in slow motion editor. Of course, a much better way would have been to record the video in 60fps then slow it down in Adobe Premiere.</description>
