Yes, you can connect a floppy drive to the Galaxy S7 or any Android device really. Just something random and simple I wanted to share. Of course&amp;#8230;I don&amp;#8217;t know why you would actually want to connect a floppy drive to your device.</description>

      <description>Do you want to get the fastest speed available on your Android device? Sure, LTE is fast and all but you&amp;#8217;re hit with really small data caps. WiFi doesn&amp;#8217;t impose the same limitations, but the speed is never consistent. So why not just connect Android to Ethernet?
Luckily, Android Marshmallow comes to the rescue. Android Marshmallow introduces new drivers that allow you to connect your Android device directly to an Ethernet cable without needingÂ root!</description>

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you didn&amp;#8217;t have a flash drive handy? Well, the other day I was trying to re-install Windows on my laptop, and sure enough, my USB flash drive conveniently went missing.

      <description>Windows 8 is old news now, look at running Windows 10 on your Chromebook! So you want to run Windows 8 on your Chromebook? Well congratulations, you clicked on the right link. Let me first ask you a question. Are you looking for a fully responsive, practical and reliable Windows 8 chromebook system? If so, then go out and buy a Windows netbook. While running Windows 8 on your Chromebook is feasible, there are a lot of driver hurdles and hardware limitations (depending on your Chromebook model) that you will have to overcome before this becomes a practical solution.</description>
