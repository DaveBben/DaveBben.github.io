      <description>Consider this, you are sitting across the room chilling on your couch and you&amp;#8217;re starting to fall asleep. Here&amp;#8217;s the problem, your couch feels so good and you don&amp;#8217;t want to get up to lock your computer, but you need to because you have nosy roommates. So wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be great if you could remotely lock it from your phone? Okay, so even if this situation is completely unbelievable, this is still something cool to try and do.</description>

      <description>Security means everything to me. I am that guy who uses two step authentication on everything, along with safety backups and more. When it comes to security on Android, things aren&amp;#8217;t as tight as I would like them to be. On my S6, my favorite thing to use is the fingerprint scanner. I am aware that the fingerprint scanner does not offer better security than a strong password or lock pattern (although you could easily bypass the Android Lockscreen pattern), however, it will deter most people fromÂ trying to snoop around in my phone.</description>
