      <description>Suppose that you developed an app that will give users free stuff when they click a button. Obviously, there&amp;#8217;s nothing stopping one user from spamming the button one million times and collecting a whole bunch of free stuff. If you wanted to prevent that, you could use something like a CAPTCHA, or perhaps give each user a session and cool off period. You could also implement something called a proof of work system.</description>
