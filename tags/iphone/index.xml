      <description>Would you only buy a Galaxy or iPhone?   So the other day, I was chatting with my friend about new smartphones. He currently owns the Galaxy S5 and was thinking about either upgrading to the Galaxy S6 or the iPhone. I jokingly informed him that there are other Android smartphone manufacturers such as HTC, LG, Motorola, etc. However he told me, &amp;#8220;Dave, honestly, unless it&amp;#8217;s a Galaxy or iPhone, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t consider buying it.</description>
