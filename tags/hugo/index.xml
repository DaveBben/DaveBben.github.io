      <description>WordPress isn&amp;rsquo;t awful. In fact, I recommend WordPress to everyone who wants to start a blog. Despite this, I switched from WordPress to Hugo a couple of weeks ago. The real reason came down to cost and simplicity.
Cost Running a WordPress blog meant that I needed a good shared hosting environment with a MySQL server and PHP execution. I first tried Hostgator, and it was sufficient enough while my blog had less than a hundred of visitors per month.</description>

      <description>Setting up search on your static site built using Hugo or Jekyll is not as difficult as it sounds. If your static site is hosted on GitHub pages (which mine currently is), then you will not be able to use php or any server side scripting. Therefore, we must rely on a pure javascript solution.
Using Lunr.js Lunr is a popular library used to parse through data and return the most accurate match based on a search query.</description>
