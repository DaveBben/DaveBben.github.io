      <description>Up until graduation day, everything made sense. I&amp;rsquo;ll go to class, get good grades, then land a decent paying job so that I can move out of my parents and &amp;ldquo;start my life&amp;rdquo;. Amazingly, all of that happened fresh out of college at 22 years old. Back then, a couple of my peers have told me, &amp;ldquo;Damn dude, you&amp;rsquo;re living the dream.&amp;rdquo; In reality, I felt like I was far from it.</description>

      <description>I am beginning to see the relationship between happiness, anticipation and dopamine.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for reward-driven behavior and pleasure seeking. (Psychology Today). When we get a hit of dopamine, we feel good!
Anticipation is the simple act of looking forward; usually to a pleasurable experience but it could also be negative.
In my previous post about Proven Ways to be Happy Again, I mentioned this thing called hedonic adaptation.</description>
