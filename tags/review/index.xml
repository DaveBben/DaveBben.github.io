      <title>Pixel 3 Review – Don’t Romanticize Imperfection</title>

      <description>Let&amp;#8217;s not romanticize imperfection. The Pixel 3 is not _The Little Engine That Could, _or some gifted boy who was born without legs. There are people out there who treat Google like the underdog; despite the fact that they have full control over the future of Android. And while there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having favorites in a race, it can be dangerous to idolize a runner just based off his shoes.</description>

      <title>LG G6 Unboxing</title>

      <description>The LG G6 is a phone with little bezel and lots of curves. The rounded corners of the LG G6 look nice but definitely take some time to get used to. Is the LG G6 better than the Samsung Galaxy S8? Who will win the ultimate battle of LG G6 vs Samsung Galaxy S8? Only time will tell.</description>

      <title>Best Android Smartwatch 2016</title>

      <description>I have been using the Huawei Watch for over two months now and I can safely say that it&amp;#8217;s the best Android smartwatch that I have ever owned. It features a high-quality aluminum design with a crisp 400 x 400 AMOLED display. There&amp;#8217;s even a speaker so that you can make phone calls and listen to music right from the watch. The only two things that I don&amp;#8217;t like about this watch is the weak vibration motor and the annoying pin charging mechanism.</description>

      <description>The Galaxy S7 Review is here. Although I am very critical on Samsung&amp;#8217;s skin, I would say that the S7/S7 edge might be the best smartphone of 2016.</description>

      <description>tl;dr
The LG G4 is seriously one of the best Android smartphones of 2015. It might not have the most attractive design on the outside and in the UI, but it is very responsive and can last you through a whole day with moderate-heavy usage.
The LG G4 Quick Review: Here is a quick review of the LG G4.
Screen: The LG G4 has a 2560x1440p display. LG calls it a quantum HD display.</description>

      <description>LG G4 Gaming Performance: Here is a quick look at the LG G4 gaming performance. If you are worried with LG&amp;#8217;s decision to use the Snapdragon 808 over the Snapdragon 810, don&amp;#8217;t be. In my testing, I used graphics heavy games such as GTA Vice City and Goat Simulator along with Real Racing 3. I could not get the device to lag, even with all the in game settings set to the max.</description>

      <title>Galaxy S6 Slow Motion Video</title>
      <link>https://www.bennettnotes.com/galaxy-s6-slow-motion-video/</link>

      <description>Slow Motion seems to be all the rage these days. Every one is trying to do it. It should come as no surprise that the Galaxy S6 also features this. While the Galaxy S6 slow motion video capabilities don&amp;#8217;t exactly rival those of the iPhone, it&amp;#8217;s still pretty good in its own right. In this video, I use the built in slow motion editor. Of course, a much better way would have been to record the video in 60fps then slow it down in Adobe Premiere.</description>
